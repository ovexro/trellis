# Changelog

All notable changes to Trellis will be documented in this file.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-08

The remote-access release. The v0.3.4 token gate was the prerequisite that made it safe to expose `:9090` beyond the LAN — this release ships everything you need to actually do that, with first-class support for two transports and a token-aware web dashboard that survives the trip through a tunnel.

### Added — Remote access via Cloudflare Tunnel and Tailscale Funnel

- **The user demand.** "I want to flip a switch from outside the house" was the #1 unsolved request after v0.3.4 closed the LAN-exposure surface. Now that the auth boundary exists, layering a tunnel on top is the obvious next step. v0.4.0 picks two transports, documents both end-to-end, and ships the small client-side and server-side changes needed to make the existing dashboard usable through them — without bundling any third-party agents.
- **Cloudflare Tunnel (recommended).** Free, no inbound port, terminates TLS at the edge, brandable URL on your own domain (`https://trellis.<your-domain>`). Composes with Cloudflare Access for free SSO if you want defense in depth on top of the token gate. Settings → Remote Access has a step-by-step recipe.
- **Tailscale Funnel (no-domain alternative).** Three commands (`tailscale up`, `tailscale funnel 9090 on`, done). URL is `*.ts.net`. Personal use is free.
- **No bundled agents.** The user installs `cloudflared` or `tailscale` themselves; Trellis just walks them through it and verifies the result. Keeps the `.deb` lean and avoids re-vendoring third-party software.
- **Token-aware embedded web UI.** The thick-client dashboard at `:9090/` (the same `web_ui.html` that's been there since v0.2.0) now picks up an API token from `localStorage`. On loopback no token is needed and the dashboard works exactly as before. Through a tunnel, the first `/api/*` fetch returns 401, an inline modal pops up asking for a token, the user pastes it once, the page reloads, and every subsequent fetch carries `Authorization: Bearer trls_…`. The token is stored in the browser's `localStorage` and never leaves the client. Wrong-prefix tokens get rejected client-side before round-tripping.
- **`GET /` always allowed by the auth gate.** Pre-auth special case in `api.rs::handle_connection`. The HTML itself contains no secrets and no device data — every dynamic surface (`/api/*`) still goes through the v0.3.4 token gate and is unchanged. This is what makes the dashboard reachable through a tunnel without breaking the rest of the security model.
- **Reachability probe.** New `probe_remote_url` Tauri command. The Settings panel includes a "Test reachability" widget that takes a public URL + a token and runs a single `GET /api/devices` from the desktop machine through the user's tunnel and back. Classifies the result into `success`, `auth_failed`, `not_trellis`, `tunnel_down`, `network_error`, `timeout`, or `unexpected`, and surfaces a human-friendly explanation. Lets users verify the setup before pulling out their phone — no copy-paste curl gymnastics. The token is held in component memory only; only the URL is persisted (as a convenience between probes).
- **Safety check on the Settings panel.** If the user has zero API tokens minted and tries to set up remote access, the panel shows an amber warning card explaining that the tunnel would be reachable but completely unusable without a token. Points them at the API Tokens section above.
- **`require_auth_localhost` interaction.** The strict-loopback opt-in from v0.3.4 still applies to `/api/*`, but the new `GET /` bypass is unconditional — the page itself is harmless static HTML. If you have strict-loopback on, the dashboard at `localhost:9090/` will still load, but its first API fetch will 401 and pop the auth modal locally. Same behaviour as the remote case, intentionally.
- **`auth_required_html` removed.** The friendly HTML 401 page that v0.3.4 served at non-loopback `GET /` is gone — the dashboard itself now handles the "I need to authenticate" UX with the inline modal. Removing dead code.
- **CHANGELOG explicitly out of scope:** WebSocket reverse-proxy through `:9090` (would let per-device `:8080` dashboards be remotely accessible too), multi-user RBAC, token expiry/TTL, rate limiting, ngrok support (free tier rotates URLs, paid is worse than the two options above).

### Documentation

- New §16 **Remote Access** in `docs/guide.md` walks through both transports end-to-end, the test-reachability widget, the "mint a token first" prerequisite, and a one-paragraph "why not ngrok" note. Subsequent sections renumbered.
- §17 (Web Dashboard) updated to mention the inline auth modal as the new auth UX through tunnels.
- FEATURES.md gains a Remote Access section.

### Verified

- `cargo build --release` clean (only the 2 pre-existing dead-code warnings from `connection.rs`).
- `cargo test --lib` 6/6 auth tests pass (no regressions; v0.4.0 is a no-op on the auth boundary itself).
- Frontend `tsc --noEmit` and `vite build` clean.
- Library code is **byte-identical** to v0.3.4 except the version macro (3-line diff in `library.json`, `library.properties`, `Trellis.h`). Per the project's hardware-test rule, no ESP32 re-flash needed for this release — the `.bin` would be provably identical.
- Embedded binary contains the new symbols (`authModal`, `TRELLIS_TOKEN_KEY`, `saveAuthToken`, `probe_remote_url`) — verified via `strings` against the release binary.

### Out of scope (deliberately deferred)

- **Per-device `:8080` dashboards via the tunnel.** Each ESP32 has its own embedded dashboard that uses its own WebSocket on `port+1`. Proxying just the HTML through `:9090` would give a static-looking page with dead controls — fixing it requires WebSocket-aware reverse-proxying through `:9090`, which the current hand-rolled HTTP server doesn't support. Punted to v0.5.0 if there's user demand. The central `:9090` web UI already aggregates every device, so for remote use it's strictly better anyway.
- **Multi-user / RBAC.** Currently every token has full admin access. Tokens have names but no scopes.
- **Token TTL / expiry.** Same model as v0.3.4: valid until revoked.
- **Rate limiting + failed-auth backoff.** Separate hardening pass.
- **Bundling `cloudflared` or `tailscale`.** Out of scope on principle — re-vendoring third-party agents grows the binary, complicates the supply chain, and adds an upgrade burden. Users install them via their distribution's package manager or the upstream installer.

## [0.3.4] — 2026-04-08

A focused security release that finishes closing the LAN-exposure surface that v0.3.3 only partially addressed. The REST API on port 9090 is now token-gated for every non-loopback request.

### Added — REST API authentication tokens

- **The risk model.** v0.3.3 patched one specific leak (the MQTT broker password was being returned in `GET /api/settings/mqtt` over the LAN), but the underlying problem was untouched: the REST API binds to `0.0.0.0:9090` with **zero authentication** for any of its ~30 endpoints. Anyone on the same WiFi could `curl /api/devices/foo/command` to flip switches, drain sensor history, mint webhooks, or read every setting key. The MQTT redaction was a band-aid; this release closes the wound.
- **Bearer tokens, scoped to the REST API.** New `api_tokens` SQLite table stores `(name, sha256-hex digest, created_at, last_used_at)` rows. Tokens are minted in plaintext, returned to the user **exactly once** at creation, and immediately hashed for storage. A stolen database cannot be used to make authenticated requests — the attacker would need to brute-force a 256-bit secret.
- **Token format.** `trls_<43 chars of base64url-no-pad>` (32 bytes from `OsRng`, total length 48). The `trls_` prefix mirrors `ghp_` etc. — greppable in logs and trivially distinguishable from other secrets in a config file.
- **Auth gate logic in `api.rs`.** Every request runs through `auth::check_auth` before route dispatch. CORS preflight (`OPTIONS`) is always allowed; loopback requests (127.0.0.1, ::1) are bypassed by default so the desktop app's embedded WebView and any local CLI work with zero setup; non-loopback requests **always** require a valid `Authorization: Bearer trls_…` header. There is no opt-out and no read-only fallback — if you want LAN access, you mint a token. The first-time user gets a distinct, helpful error message ("open Settings → API Tokens and click Create") instead of the generic "missing Authorization header".
- **Strict-loopback opt-in.** New `require_auth_localhost` setting (off by default). When on, even loopback requests must present a token — defense in depth against malicious local processes on a shared machine. The desktop app authenticates over Tauri IPC, not HTTP, so it's unaffected, but local CLI tools and the embedded `localhost:9090/` web dashboard will then also need a token.
- **Friendly HTML for browser users.** A non-loopback `GET /` (the embedded web dashboard, which is a thick client polling `/api/*` from the same origin) returns a styled HTML page explaining what happened and how to authenticate, instead of a bare JSON 401 dumped onto the user's screen. Points users at the Trellis desktop app, the per-device dashboard at `<device-ip>:8080/`, or the curl token flow.
- **Token management.** Three new Tauri commands (`list_api_tokens`, `create_api_token`, `revoke_api_token`) and three new REST endpoints (`GET/POST/DELETE /api/tokens`) — the REST endpoints are themselves gated by the same auth check, so you can't mint a token from outside without already having one (or being on loopback). The Settings UI grows an **API Tokens** section with a name input, a one-shot "your token is" modal that surfaces the plaintext exactly once with copy + curl-snippet hints, a list of existing tokens with `created_at` / `last_used_at` columns, and a per-row revoke button. Revocation is immediate — the next request bearing that token gets 401.
- **`auth.rs` module.** Token generation, SHA-256 hashing, Bearer header parsing, loopback detection, and the `check_auth` middleware live in their own module so the Tauri command layer and the HTTP middleware share one implementation. 6 unit tests cover token shape, hash stability, scheme parsing, and loopback detection — `cargo test --lib auth::` is the gate.
- **New deps.** `sha2 = "0.10"`, `rand = "0.8"`. Both are tiny, audited, and battle-tested.
- **Verified end-to-end** on the cross-subnet ESP32 at `192.168.1.108`. From a non-loopback IP: `curl http://desktop-pc:9090/api/devices` → 401 with "Authentication required" body; mint a token in Settings → curl with `Authorization: Bearer trls_…` → 200 with the device list; `last_used_at` updates on the next list refresh; revoke the token → next request → 401. From loopback: everything continues to work without setup. The friendly HTML page renders correctly for browser navigation to `http://desktop-pc:9090/`. Toggling strict-loopback mode flips the localhost behaviour as expected.
- **Upgrading from v0.3.3.** The behavior change is loud: any consumer that was talking to the REST API from a non-loopback IP needs a token. The desktop app and the localhost dashboard continue to work with zero changes. The user guide now has a full "Authentication" subsection in §15 with the curl recipe.

### Out of scope (deliberately deferred)

- **Multi-user / role-based access control.** This release gates the existing single-user surface; full RBAC is the next layer up.
- **Token expiry / TTL.** v1 is "valid until revoked" like GitHub PATs. Add later if a workflow needs it.
- **Rate limiting / IP allowlists / failed-auth backoff.** Separate hardening pass.
- **Cookie/session auth, OAuth, JWT.** Bearer tokens are enough for a programmatic API.
- **Auth on the embedded device's own dashboard at `:8080/`.** That's served by the Arduino library, on the device itself, and is a separate trust boundary. Untouched here.

## [0.3.3] — 2026-04-08

A four-fix maintenance release covering security, UX, and connectivity follow-ups noticed during the v0.2.0 → v0.3.2 sessions. No new top-level features; existing flows get materially safer and more usable.

### Fixed — saved devices auto-load on app restart

- **The bug.** Cross-subnet devices added via "Add by IP" disappeared from the desktop app on every restart and had to be re-added manually. The `deviceStore` had hydration code that loaded saved devices from SQLite as offline placeholders, but it raced with `refreshDevices()`'s `set({ devices })` clobber: Tauri processes sync IPC commands roughly in queue order, so `get_saved_devices` returned first → React appended the offline placeholders → then `refreshDevices` returned and wiped the array. mDNS rediscovered same-subnet devices within 1-2 seconds via the additive event listener (masking the bug in dev), but cross-subnet devices stayed missing. Discovered during MQTT testing with a cross-subnet ESP32.
- **The fix.** Hydration moves into the Rust backend (`Discovery::hydrate_from_db`) so every consumer benefits — desktop UI, REST API at `:9090`, mobile web dashboard, MQTT bridge. Called from `lib.rs` setup between `init_db` and `start_background`. Capabilities and system info are refetched from the device on the first health-check probe (which now runs immediately at startup instead of waiting a full 30-second interval).
- The `health_check_loop` was restructured to "work, then sleep" instead of "sleep, then work". Cross-subnet hydrated devices flip online within ~1 second of app launch instead of 30+ seconds.
- The React-side hydration block was simplified to just enrich existing devices with React-only metadata (nickname/tags/group_id) since the backend now owns the device list — no more ghost-device manufacturing, no more clobber race.
- **Verified end-to-end.** Cross-subnet ESP32 (`trellis-fccfb7c8` at `192.168.1.108` from a `192.168.2.x` dev machine) reappears in `/api/devices` fully populated with `online: true` and four capabilities within 1 second of `trellis` launch.

### Fixed — MQTT broker password no longer leaked over the LAN, encrypted at rest

This started as "encrypt the password at rest" and grew after discovering a more urgent network leak during the implementation read-through.

- **Network leak (sub-fix A).** The REST API binds to `0.0.0.0:9090` (so the mobile web dashboard can reach it from a phone), and `GET /api/settings/mqtt` was returning the **plaintext** broker password in the response body. Anyone on the same WiFi could `curl` it and walk away with credentials that typically grant control of the user's entire smart home. The Tauri `get_mqtt_config` command had the same shape but is only callable from inside the desktop app — not network-exposed but worth fixing for consistency.
- **The redaction.** Introduced a new `MqttConfigPublic` struct that omits `password` and adds a `has_password: bool` flag. Used by both `get_mqtt_config` (Tauri) and `GET /api/settings/mqtt` (REST). The plaintext is never serialized to a user-facing endpoint.
- **Preserve-blank save semantics.** When the form submits a config with an empty `password` field, the backend now keeps the existing stored password rather than blanking it out — the form loads with empty password (because GET redacts it), and a save round-trip would otherwise wipe it on every Save & apply. New `merge_preserving_password()` + `apply_config_from_user()` / `test_connection_from_user()` wrappers apply the merge; the internal `apply_config()` / `test_connection()` stay raw and are used by the trusted startup-load path.
- **Explicit clear path.** New `clear_mqtt_password` Tauri command and `POST /api/mqtt/clear-password` REST endpoint for the "I really want to remove the stored password" UX. Without this, users could never clear a password (empty field = preserve). Settings UI grows a Clear button next to the password field that appears when a password is currently stored.
- **Sensitive-key blocklist.** `GET` and `PUT` to `/api/settings/<key>` now return 403 for any key in the `SENSITIVE_SETTING_KEYS` allowlist (currently just `mqtt_config`). Stops the generic key-value getter from being used to bypass the typed endpoint's redaction.
- **At-rest encryption (sub-fix B).** `secret_store.rs` wraps an `age` x25519 identity stored in the OS keyring (Linux Secret Service via `libsecret`) with a 0600 key file fallback at `<app_data_dir>/secret.key` for headless setups. Wire format for stored passwords is `enc:v1:<base64>` where the base64 payload is binary age ciphertext. The encryption/decryption boundary is the SQLite write/read for `mqtt_config` — wired into `set_mqtt_config` (Tauri), `PUT /api/settings/mqtt` (REST), `clear_mqtt_password`, and the startup load path in `lib.rs`.
- **Lazy migration.** At startup, if the loaded `mqtt_config` has a plaintext password (from a pre-encryption build), the bridge gets it as-is so it keeps working, and the config is re-saved encrypted. Migration completes on the very first launch of this build with no user action.
- **New deps.** `age 0.10`, `base64 0.22`, `keyring 3` (with `sync-secret-service` + `vendored`). `keyring` pulls in vendored openssl, adding ~30 s to a cold build but keeping the binary self-contained for the deb/rpm/AppImage.
- **Settings UI.** Password input loads empty, placeholder switches between `(none)` and `(unchanged — type to update)` based on `has_password`, Clear button appears when a password is currently stored.
- **Verified end-to-end.** `curl GET /api/settings/mqtt` no longer contains a `password` field; `/api/settings/mqtt_config` returns 403; planted a legacy plaintext blob in SQLite, launched trellis, the blob became `enc:v1:<base64>` automatically; second restart decrypted cleanly; PUT with empty password preserved the existing one; POST clear-password emptied it; the bridge stayed connected through all of it.

### Added — TLS broker support (rustls + custom CA)

Builds on the password fixes above. The previous work keeps credentials out of GET responses and SQLite plaintext; this work encrypts them in flight so brokers reachable over the public internet (or any untrusted network) are usable.

- **Two new `MqttConfig` fields**: `tls_enabled: bool` (default `false` for back-compat with existing local-broker setups) and `tls_ca_cert_path: Option<String>` (None = system trust roots, Some = read PEM from this path and use **only** this CA). Both have `serde` defaults so legacy configs from pre-TLS builds parse cleanly.
- **rumqttc 0.24's default feature is `use-rustls`**, so TLS is already linked — no Cargo.toml changes for the TLS code path. New `build_tls_transport()` helper constructs the right `Transport` variant from the `MqttConfig` and is wired into both `MqttBridge::start()` (live bridge) and `::test_connection()` (Settings UI test button).
- **Settings UI** grows a collapsible TLS subsection: enable checkbox + Tauri-dialog file picker for the CA cert (with PEM extension filter) + helper text. Toggling TLS on auto-bumps the broker port from 1883 → 8883 if it was still on the plaintext default.
- **`MqttConfigPublic` exposes the new fields** — they're not sensitive (the CA path is just a filesystem location, `tls_enabled` is operational state).
- **Verified end-to-end.** Public brokers `broker.emqx.io:8883` and `broker.hivemq.com:8883` connect cleanly using system trust roots. Local Mosquitto on `:18883` with a self-signed CA + server cert pair connects when pointed at the CA path, fails with `UnknownIssuer` without it (correct behaviour), and a bogus CA path returns a clean file-not-found error (no panic). TLS config persists across `trellis` restart and the bridge auto-reconnects.
- **Two rustls strictness gotchas worth knowing.** `test.mosquitto.org:8883` fails with `UnsupportedCertVersion` because their cert has a non-RFC-compliant version field — rustls is stricter than OpenSSL. Production brokers (the ones users actually integrate against) work fine. Self-signed certs generated with the default `openssl req -x509` don't include `basicConstraints=CA:TRUE`, so rustls rejects them as a CA with `CaUsedAsEndEntity` — users with self-signed setups need either the basic-constraint extension OR a proper CA + server cert pair.
- **`insecure_skip_verify` was intentionally not implemented.** It's a security footgun and there's no realistic case where it makes a user safer than the CA file path. If you have a workflow that needs it, it's an additive follow-up.

### Fixed — embedded web UI cache invalidates correctly across firmware updates

- **The bug.** The on-device dashboard sent `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300`, meaning browsers cached on the old HTML wouldn't pull new HTML for up to 5 minutes after an OTA push. Hot-reload during library development had the same friction — every `web_ui.html` edit needed a hard-reload or a 5-minute wait.
- **The fix.** ETag-based conditional GET tied to a content hash:
    `"<TRELLIS_VERSION>-<sha256-prefix-of-HTML>"`
  e.g. `"0.3.3-c443bd0afb4c2bfd"`. The version prefix is for human inspection (curl the / endpoint, see what firmware you're talking to). The content-hash suffix is the actual cache key — if the embedded HTML changes, the hash changes, the ETag changes, browsers pull the new content. **Critically, this means a release that forgets to bump `TRELLIS_VERSION` still gets correct cache invalidation as long as the HTML actually changed.** Belt and suspenders.
- `scripts/build_web_ui_header.py` emits a new `TRELLIS_WEB_UI_HTML_HASH` constant alongside the existing PROGMEM byte array — first 16 hex chars of `sha256(html)`. 64 bits is collision-negligible for ETag purposes and keeps the header compact.
- `TrellisWebServer::begin` now calls `_http->collectHeaders()` with `If-None-Match` before `_http->begin()`. The Arduino `WebServer` library drops unregistered request headers silently — without this, the conditional GET path never fires and there's no error to debug.
- `Cache-Control` becomes `no-cache, must-revalidate` (browser must revalidate every load, but can reuse the cached body when the server says 304).
- **Verified end-to-end on real ESP32**: first GET → 200 + ETag + 25668-byte body; GET with correct `If-None-Match` → 304 + empty body + ETag header still set; GET with wrong `If-None-Match` → 200 + full body. All five examples × ESP32/Pico W still compile clean (sizes match v0.3.1 baseline; ETag code adds <200 bytes). `arduino-lint --library-manager update` clean.

### Fixed — `TRELLIS_VERSION` macro in sync with the published library version

- **The bug.** The v0.3.2 release left `TRELLIS_VERSION` in `src/Trellis.h` on `"0.3.1"` because `reference_build.md`'s procedural recipe omitted it from the version-bump checklist (even though `feedback_release_sync.md` had it listed). The published v0.3.2 library binary reported the wrong version internally — and now that the embedded UI ETag depends on this macro, a mismatch would skip cache invalidation entirely.
- **The fix.** Bumped the macro to `"0.3.3"` for this release. The release procedure documentation has been updated to make `src/Trellis.h` the sixth file in the version-bump list (was five). The content-hash half of the ETag is a backstop that catches HTML changes even if you forget the version bump, but it's not a substitute for keeping the macro in sync.

### Notes

- No new user-facing features. Five existing flows (saved-devices restore, MQTT password handling, MQTT TLS, web-UI cache, version macro) get materially safer or more usable.
- All four follow-up tasks were verified end-to-end on real hardware: cross-subnet ESP32 at `192.168.1.108` (saved-devices fix), local Mosquitto on `127.0.0.1:18883` with a self-signed CA pair (TLS), `test/TestDevice` flashed via `/dev/ttyUSB0` (ETag round-trip), and the encrypted MQTT password migration was exercised against the live SQLite store.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-04-07

### Release infrastructure

- **Lean Arduino Library Manager tarball.** The published `Trellis-X.Y.Z.zip` on Arduino LM drops from ~740 KB / 122 files (entire monorepo, including the Tauri desktop app source, both lockfiles, and 530 KB of screenshots) to ~50 KB / 25 files (library only). No library code changes — same `src/`, same examples, same API. Achieved by tagging future releases from a lean orphan `library-release` branch (managed by `scripts/release-library.sh`) instead of from `main`. The desktop CI still builds from main's tree by reading a `main-sha:` line embedded in the tag annotation.
- **Why this was needed.** The Arduino Library Manager indexer (`arduino/libraries-repository-engine`) walks the cloned repo with `filepath.Walk()` and only excludes SCCS dirs, symlinks, and dotfiles — it does **not** honor `.gitattributes export-ignore`. Our `git archive` produced a clean ~50 KB tarball already, but the indexer ignored it. Forcing the indexer to see only library files required a separate, lean commit at the tag.
- **Old tags unchanged.** v0.1.8 → v0.3.1 stay bloated in the LM index (immutable index entries). Only v0.3.2 onward will be lean. PIO is unaffected — it has always honored `library.json export.include`.
- **Releases must now use the script.** `./scripts/release-library.sh vX.Y.Z` is the only supported way to tag a release; raw `git tag && git push` will fail loudly because `release.yml` requires the `main-sha:` line in the tag annotation.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-04-07

### Added — embedded web dashboard polish pass

Three on-device dashboard features that turn the v0.3.0 control panel into a real debug + monitoring console for any phone:

- **Live log viewer panel.** A "Logs" chip in the dashboard header opens a collapsible panel that streams `event:"log"` WebSocket messages from the device in real time. Severity-coloured rows (info / warn / error), monospace formatting, scrollable ring buffer of the last 200 lines, Pause and Clear controls, and an unread-count badge on the chip when the panel is collapsed. The library already broadcast logs via `broadcastLog`/`logInfo`/`logWarn`/`logError` — this pass is purely the consumer side, no C++ changes required.
- **OTA progress overlay.** When a device emits `event:"ota_progress"` (currently the start tick at `percent: 0` and the failure tick at `percent: -1`), a full-screen modal appears with a progress bar, status text, and reboot detection. On a successful update the WebSocket closes when the device reboots; the overlay flips to "Restarting device…" and auto-reloads the page once the device is back so the new firmware version appears immediately. On failure the overlay shows a red error state with a dismiss button.
- **Add to Home Screen hint.** A one-time bottom sheet that appears on mobile viewports (`window.innerWidth < 768` plus iOS or Android UA detection) with platform-specific wording ("Tap Share, then Add to Home Screen" on iOS / "Tap menu (⋮), then Add to Home Screen" on Android). Skipped automatically when already running standalone or after the user dismisses it (stored in localStorage). Paired with `mobile-web-app-capable`, `theme-color`, and a 180×180 `apple-touch-icon` so iOS Safari renders the saved icon properly with no manifest URL.

### Polish pass

- **Header layout reflow** to accommodate the new chip without breaking on narrow viewports. The title block now uses a dedicated `.ttl` flex child with `min-width:0` and ellipsis overflow so the device name truncates instead of pushing the chip off-screen, and the chip is `flex:none` so it always reserves its slot.
- **Defense-in-depth XSS hygiene** for the new code paths: log message bodies render through `textContent`, severity is filtered to a known whitelist before being interpolated into class names, and the OTA progress percent is `Math.max(0,Math.min(100,p|0))` clamped before being used as a CSS width.
- **Latent bug fix**: the `info` global was being implicitly created via `info=d` in `loadInfo()` (declared nowhere, leaked to `window`). Now declared in the IIFE-scope `var` list alongside `caps`/`ws`/etc. Spotted while reading the code for the polish pass.
- **`overflow-x:hidden` on body** as a safety net so any future flex/grid mishap can't trigger horizontal scroll on phones.
- **OTA reset semantics**: `otaShow()` now resets state on every call (clears the timer, removes `.fail`, resets the bar) so a fresh OTA after a previous failure starts cleanly without forcing the user to dismiss the old overlay first.
- **Log unread counter** correctly resets to zero both when the panel is opened *and* when it's resumed from a paused state.
- **Hardware-verified end-to-end** on real ESP32: TestDevice flashed via `/dev/ttyUSB0`, HTTP fetch returns the new 25 KB byte-clean HTML with all three feature markers present, WebSocket round-trip exercises both the existing command path (`set led true` → device acts → update broadcast) and the new log path (`logInfo` from the `onCommand` callback + periodic ticks received). Headless Chrome screenshots at desktop and mobile viewports confirm the chip + responsive grid + PWA hint render correctly.

### Notes

- Headless Chrome (`google-chrome --headless=new`) has a hard minimum viewport width of ~500 px regardless of `--window-size`. Mobile screenshot tests of viewports narrower than that are unreliable and will appear right-clipped — the actual page layout is fine, the screenshot just isn't capturing what the rendering engine reports. Use puppeteer/playwright with `Page.setViewport` (CDP `Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride`) for true narrow-viewport tests.
- Embedded HTML grew from ~13 KB to ~25 KB; ESP32 flash usage stays at 82-83 % across all five examples, Pico W at ~22 %.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added

- **Embedded web dashboard on the device**. Trellis devices now serve a self-contained control panel at `GET /` straight from PROGMEM. Flash any example, open `http://<device-ip>/` from your phone or laptop, and you get a polished dark-theme dashboard with live toggles for switches, sliders for sliders, sensors with units, native color picker, and text input — all driven by the existing `/api/info` + WebSocket protocol. No desktop app required, no install, no cloud, no second device. Verified end-to-end on a real ESP32 (HTTP fetch + WS round-trip + all 5 capability types rendered).
- The dashboard is a single 13 KB vanilla HTML/CSS/JS file (`src/web_ui.html`) embedded as a PROGMEM byte array (`src/TrellisWebUI_html.h`, regenerated by `scripts/build_web_ui_header.py`). Streamed to clients via `WebServer::send_P` so it never lands in RAM. Includes inline SVG favicon, Apple home-screen meta tags, mobile-first responsive grid (single column on phones, two columns on tablet+), a 5-item sensor/heap/uptime/RSSI tile bar, and live WebSocket reconnect with status pill.
- New library API: `Trellis::enableWebUI(bool enabled = true)`. Default-on so existing sketches inherit the feature for free; pass `false` before *or after* `begin()` to disable (the route handler checks the flag at request time, so toggling at runtime works). Saves ~13 KB of flash when disabled.
- All five examples (BasicSwitch, TemperatureSensor, RGBLed, GreenhouseController, AutoConnect) had their header comments updated to mention the embedded dashboard so users discover it without reading source.
- Library version constant fixed: `TRELLIS_VERSION` was stuck at "0.1.5" through several releases — now properly tracks the actual library version and bumps to "0.3.0".

### Polish pass

- **Defense-in-depth XSS escape** for cap labels/units in the embedded JS. The values are sketch-author-controlled at compile time so they're trusted, but the JS now uses `textContent` everywhere it can and a tiny `esc()` helper for the few innerHTML paths (slider min/max ranges, sensor units). Cheap insurance against future paths that might accept untrusted input.
- **Inline SVG favicon** to avoid the spurious `/favicon.ico` 404 (and the wasted ESP32 request handler tick) on every page load.
- **Cache-Control headers**: dashboard HTML is `public, max-age=300` so phones don't re-download 13 KB on every refresh; `/api/info` is `no-store` to keep capability lists fresh.
- **Generator script** (`scripts/build_web_ui_header.py`) replaces the ad-hoc inline-Python generator. Strips POSIX trailing newline from the source HTML so the served body is byte-clean.
- **Cross-platform sanity check**: all five examples compile clean on both ESP32 (~82% flash) and Raspberry Pi Pico W (~21% flash) with the new feature.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-04-07

### Fixed (MQTT bridge — caught by HA Docker bonus test)

The HA Docker integration test surfaced two related bugs in the MQTT bridge that v0.2.0's polish pass missed: rumqttc's internal reconnect does NOT replay either retained publishes or subscriptions, so a broker restart left the bridge "connected but functionally broken".

- **Republish retained `online` availability on every ConnAck** (polish #4). When the broker restarts (or the network blips long enough for the TCP connection to drop), Mosquitto fires our LWT (`offline`) on the availability topic. rumqttc reconnects under us and the bridge keeps publishing state — but the availability topic still reads `offline` until something forces a republish, so HA marks every entity unavailable. The fix re-asserts `online` in the ConnAck handler.
- **Re-subscribe to `<base_topic>/+/+/set` on every ConnAck** (polish #5). The original `start()` calls `client.subscribe()` once at startup. rumqttc reconnects automatically when the connection drops, but it does NOT replay subscriptions, so after a broker restart the bridge is "connected" yet deaf — HA toggles never reach the device, even though the messages are visible to other subscribers. The fix re-asserts the subscription in the ConnAck handler. Idempotent.

Both fixes live alongside polish #2 (republish HA discovery configs) in the same `event_loop` ConnAck branch, since they all need to fire on the same trigger.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added

- **MQTT bridge with Home Assistant discovery**. Trellis now ships an in-app MQTT bridge that mirrors every device's capabilities to a user-configured broker. When enabled, switches/sliders/sensors/colors/text capabilities are auto-published as MQTT topics under `<base_topic>/<device_id>/<cap_id>/state` and accept commands at `…/set`. With Home Assistant MQTT discovery enabled (default), devices appear in HA's UI as native entities with no YAML — switches map to `switch`, sliders to `number`, sensors to `sensor` (with units), colors to RGB `light`, and text to `text`.
- New `Settings → MQTT bridge` panel: broker host/port, username/password, base topic, HA discovery prefix + toggle, enable toggle, "Test connection" button, live status indicator (connected / enabled-but-disconnected / disabled, with last-error message and pub/sub counters).
- New Tauri commands: `get_mqtt_config`, `set_mqtt_config`, `get_mqtt_status`, `test_mqtt_connection`.
- New REST endpoints on `:9090`: `GET /api/settings/mqtt`, `PUT /api/settings/mqtt`, `GET /api/mqtt/status`. The web dashboard (and any external script) can now drive the bridge config without the desktop UI.
- **Last-will availability**: when the bridge connects it publishes `online` (retained) to `<base_topic>/bridge/availability`, and the broker auto-publishes `offline` if Trellis crashes or disconnects. HA uses this to mark entities as unavailable.

### Architecture notes

- The bridge runs as a worker thread that owns the rumqttc Client + EventLoop, started/stopped from `MqttBridge::apply_config`. When config changes the worker is cleanly stopped (offline retain message + disconnect + thread join) before a new one is spawned.
- Inbound commands are routed through the existing race-free `ConnectionManager::send_to_device` path (the post-v0.1.6 fix), so MQTT-driven commands are subject to the same correctness guarantees as the REST and Tauri command paths.
- HA discovery configs are deduped — they only republish when a device's capability list actually changes (firmware update / capability add). This avoids spamming the broker on every health-check tick.
- Empty/whitespace `base_topic` and `ha_discovery_prefix` fall back to defaults; trailing slashes are stripped. Multi-segment base topics (e.g. `home/iot/trellis`) are supported via prefix-stripping rather than naive segment counting.
- Password is stored in the SQLite settings table as plain text (same security model as the rest of the app's local-only state). TLS connections to the broker are not yet supported — MVP scope.

### Polish pass

- **Instant HA discovery on bridge enable** — `apply_config` now immediately publishes discovery configs for all currently-known devices instead of waiting for the next 30s health-check tick. Toggling the bridge on in Settings → MQTT bridge populates HA within ~1 second.
- **Republish HA discovery on broker reconnect** — the worker thread re-emits discovery configs for every known device on every successful `ConnAck`. Handles broker restarts (where retained configs are lost), transient network drops, and the laptop sleeping/waking. Idempotent: the dedupe tracker is cleared first so even already-tracked devices re-announce.
- **HA sensors for device system telemetry** — every Trellis device now gets three extra HA sensor entities (Signal strength, Free heap, Uptime) in the `diagnostic` entity category. The bridge listens for `heartbeat` events on the device WebSocket and publishes the values to `<base_topic>/<device_id>/_sys/<field>/state`. HA users can graph weak-signal warnings and memory leaks without needing the Trellis desktop app open.

### Known limitations

- The Settings UI doesn't yet show the running config diff vs the saved config; clicking "Save & apply" applies whatever is currently in the form.

## [0.1.8] — 2026-04-07

### Changed (BREAKING — repo layout)

- The Arduino library files now live at the **repository root** instead of inside `library/`. The Arduino Library Manager indexer requires `library.properties` to sit at the repo root, so this is the only way to be indexed without splitting the project into a separate repo.
- New layout at root: `src/`, `examples/`, `library.properties`, `library.json`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`. The desktop app still lives under `app/`.
- Local Arduino IDE users developing against the source: re-symlink as `ln -s /path/to/trellis ~/Arduino/libraries/Trellis` (was `…/trellis/library`).
- Added `.gitattributes` with `export-ignore` directives so `git archive` tarballs (used by some Library Manager tooling) exclude `app/`, `docs/`, `screenshots/`, `.github/`, `install.sh`, and project-meta markdowns from the library distribution.
- Updated CI (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) to compile examples from the new `examples/` path and symlink the repo root into `~/Arduino/libraries/Trellis`.
- Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `README.md` repo trees + dev install instructions.

This is a no-op for desktop app users — `Trellis_0.1.8_amd64.deb` is identical in behavior to `0.1.7`. The change only affects the Arduino library publishing path.

## [0.1.7] — 2026-04-07

### Added
- `library/LICENSE` — MIT license bundled inside the Arduino library directory so it ships with installs from Library Manager.
- `library.properties`: `includes=Trellis.h` — lets Arduino IDE auto-add the include statement on install.
- `library.json`: `AutoConnect` example registered for PlatformIO (was missing).

### Changed
- `library.json`: `frameworks` is now an array (`["arduino"]`) per PlatformIO schema preference.

These cleanups make the library pass `arduino-lint --library-manager submit` with zero errors and zero warnings, in preparation for Arduino Library Manager and PlatformIO Registry submissions.

## [0.1.6] — 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- **Critical**: desktop command relay race that dropped switch/slider/OTA commands. `send_to_device` opened a short-lived WebSocket per command and called `socket.close()` before the device's `WebSocketsServer.loop()` could dispatch the text frame to `processCommand()`. The frame was sitting in the device buffer when the disconnect tore it down, so commands appeared "sent" to the desktop but never landed on the device. Reproducible across **all** capability types (switch, slider, color, text, OTA). Discovered during hardware-test gate that should have run before v0.1.5.

### Changed
- `send_to_device` now pushes commands through an `mpsc::channel` into the existing persistent `ws_reader_loop`, which writes them on the same WebSocket it reads events from. Eliminates the short-lived-connection race entirely. A one-shot fallback (with a 200ms hold-off before close) is preserved for the brief race window before discovery establishes the persistent connection.
- Reader loop's socket read timeout dropped from 2s to 50ms so outbound commands are flushed promptly.
